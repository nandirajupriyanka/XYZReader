# User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
Lyla says:

“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”


Jay says:

“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."


Kagure says:

“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
